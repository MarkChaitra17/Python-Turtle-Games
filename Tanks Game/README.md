💣 Tanks\
A two-player artillery battle game built with Python Turtle Graphics, where you take turns aiming and firing projectiles to destroy your opponent’s tank.\
This game demonstrates projectile motion physics, random battlefield generation, and simple turn-based mechanics.

🎮 Gameplay Overview\
Two tanks — Player A (orange) and Player B (red) — face off on a destructible battlefield separated by a wall.\
Each player takes turns adjusting their cannon angle and firing bullets using physics-based trajectories.\
Your goal: reduce your opponent’s health to 0 before they do the same to you!
